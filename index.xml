      <description>I come from Quebec, Canada. I spent most of my life in the outdoors, or at least free to go take a stroll. Never in my life have I thought I would be strongly encouraged to stick within our 4 walls in Harlem. Never in my life have I stayed a whole week inside.
The family is adjusting. Working feels different. No commute or going outside for lunch. Removing the physical distance of the office requires us to enforce our own schedule so we don&amp;rsquo;t over work.</description>
